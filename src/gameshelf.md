i've always been into computer games and have played them for as long as i can remember in one way or another.

when i was very young we had a commodore 64 and a selection of games on floppy disk and a couple on cartridge. i remember all of the games that we had being very hard.

i enjoyed when we went over to friends places and they had either amigas or ibm compatibles.

my first console was a sega master system 2. we never got a mega drive and missed everything in between and wound up with a playstation at some point. we moved onto an xbox and didn't have a console again until the playstation 3 so that i could play grand theft auto 4.

outside of those, some of my best memories of gaming was on a pc. when we first got a pc, the first two games we got on cd-rom were dune 2 theme park and command and conquer.
