these are the house plants that i take care of.

## philodendron selloum ‚Äúgreen princess‚Äù
a hybrid from the philodendron family, called the philodendron selloum 'green princess'.

### light conditions
* bright indirect light to light shade.

### watering schedule
* summer watering every 7 to 10 days.
* winter watering every 10 to 14 days.

## fiddle leaf fig
a very popular indoor plant. not the easiest to look after.

### light conditions
medium to bright indirect light. will adjust to some direct light as the plant matures.

### watering schedule
* summer watering every 5 to 10 days.
* winter watering every 10 to 14 days.

the fiddle leaf fig likes its soil to be kept consistently evenly moist, with a brief drying-out period between waterings. too little water and the leaves will loose their deep green colour and wilt. too much water and it can cause the leaves to drop. during the growing season (spring to autumn), water your fiddle-leaf fig when the top inch of soil feels dry. and over the winter months, water slightly less.

## monstera deliciosa
the monstera deliciosa is a stunning indoor plant. it has large unusual split leaves.

### light conditions
* best kept in brightly lit conditions and will also tolerate partial shade. keep out of direct sunlight.

### watering schedule
* water when the soil has started to dry out.

## large philodendron "minima"
often referred to as the 'mini monstera'. has multiple growth points and can grow very large.

### light conditions
* the minima grows best in a well-lit position indoors with plenty of bright and indirect sunlight. if it is placed in a spot that is too shady it will experience slow rates of growth and potentially much smaller leaves than normal.

### watering schedule
* prefers lightly moist soil, beware of overwatering as it won't respond well, it prefers to be on the drier side.

## ficus
i need to confirm what actual variation of ficus this one is.
