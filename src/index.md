hi ðŸ‘‹, i'm [fLaMEd](about.html) ðŸ”¥ and this is my homepage, a collection of stuff that i like.

i have had a passion for making homepages for a long time. there's always been a time in my life where i have had a homepage in one form or another.

this homepage is being constructed in public, it is constantly under construction. i will often push changes to it to try things out. i spend too much time coding and configuring and need to focus on writing the never ending stream of ideas and concepts down. this is my current mission.

i chose [neocities](https://neocities.org) as my homepage host to step away from the corporate web and to not be surrounded by likes, shares, claps, stars, retweets, or whatevers. 

i love the internet, but not all things about the internet, you can read more over on my [about page](about.html). if you want to dive deeper, check out [my memoirs](memoirs.html) which detail my earliet memories of getting online and surfing the web.

### surf the web

the true spirit of the web is hyperlinking to all of the interesting homepages and websites you come across.

#### link me
you can link to my homepage using my 88x31 button, this was used for flamedfury.com back in the year 2000!

![flamedfury 88x31 link button](../img/fury.gif#center "visit flamedfury now!")

``` html
<a href="https://flamedfury.com/">
    <img src="https://flamedfury.com/img/fury.gif" alt="visit flamedfury now!" />
</a>
```

#### webrings
webrings were a fun part of the web back in the 90s and 2000s. here are a few that i've recently joined, take the time to surf around them.
