hi ðŸ‘‹, i'm [fLaMEd](about.html) ðŸ”¥ and this is my homepage, a collection of stuff that i like.

i have had a passion for making homepages for a long time. there's always been a time in my life where i have had a homepage in one form or another.

this homepage is being constructed in public, it is constantly under construction. i will often push changes to it to try things out. i spend too much time coding and configuring and need to focus on writing the never ending stream of ideas and concepts down. this is my current mission.

i chose [neocities](https://neocities.org) as my homepage host to step away from the corporate web and to not be surrounded by likes, shares, claps, stars, retweets, or whatevers.
