hi ðŸ‘‹, i'm [fLaMEd](about.html) ðŸ”¥ and this is my homepage, a collection of stuff that i like.

i have had a passion for making homepages for a long time. there's always been a time in my life where i have had a homepage in one form or another.

this homepage is being constructed in public, it is constantly under construction. i will often push changes to it to try things out. i spend too much time coding and configuring and need to focus on writing the never ending stream of ideas and concepts down. this is my current mission.

i chose [neocities](https://neocities.org) as my homepage host to step away from the corporate web and to not be surrounded by likes, shares, claps, stars, retweets, or whatevers.

i love the internet, [but not all things about the internet](manifesto.html), you can read more over on my [about page](about.html). if you want to dive deeper, check out [my memoirs](memoirs.html) which detail my earliet memories of getting online and surfing the web and my [web manifesto](manifesto.html) where i share  my thoughts on the web.

if you've enjoyed your time here, please leave a message in [my guestbook](https://guestbook.flamedfury.com).

the true spirit of the web is hyperlinking to all of the interesting homepages and websites you come across.

### webrings
webrings were a fun part of the web back in the 90s and 2000s. here are a few that i've recently joined, take the time to surf around them.
