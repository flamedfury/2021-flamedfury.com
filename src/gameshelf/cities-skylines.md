i've been enjoying cities skylines on and off since it's release back in 2015. i'm not a pro by any means and love picking up up every now and again and starting a new city. i take inspiration from pro city skylines players who share their cities and great tutorials online.

## city starter tips

- start city with dirt roads. they are cheap and have a low maintenance cost. allows to get a city started and build a positive cashflow. cars will move slow, but traffic is not an issue early on.
- use freeform road tool to develop organic grids for low density residential.
- standard grids work best for high density zoning, as these buildings benefit from being side by side.
- reduce budget for road, power, water to 50% to save money early on.
- reach little hamlet milestone and increase residential, commercial and industrial budget to 12%. (any higher and they will leave)
- save city after each milestone. save city before making major changes.
