i realise that nothing i say matters to anyone else on the entire planet. my opinions are useless and unfocused. i am an expert in nothing. i know nothing. i am confused about almost everything. i cannot, as an individual, ever possibly know everything, or even enough to make editorial commentary on the vast vast majority of things that exist in my world. this is a stupid document; it is meaningless drivel that i do not expect any of the several billion people on my planet to actually read. people who do read my rambling, incoherent dumbfuckery are probably just as confused as i am, if not moreso, as they are looking to my sorry ass for an opinion when they should be outside playing frisbee with their dog or screwing their life partner or getting a dog or getting a life partner. anyone who actually takes the time to read my bullshit probably deserves to ingest my fucked up and obviously mistaken opinions on whatever it is that i have written about.
