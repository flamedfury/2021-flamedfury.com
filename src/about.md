hey ðŸ‘‹, i'm [fLaMEd](https://neocities.org/site/flamedfury/) ðŸ”¥, and i'm the [webmaster](https://justinjackson.ca/webmaster/) of flamedfury. i have been [a citizen of the internet since 1996](memoirs.html). i love the web (as well as the internet), but not all things about the web. [i have a huge dislike for the current commercialisation, monitisation, and walled garden silo approach of the modern web](manifesto.html).

## interests

my interests are many.

i enjoy keeping fit, either by working out in my garage gym or walking the dogs twice a day.

working out, walking the dogs, or chores around the house, i'm most likley [listening to music](../recordshelf.html). it's not often that i'm not!

i enjoy reading, both [books](../bookshelf.html) and [comic books](../comicbookrack.html). if i'm not in the mood for reading i enjoy nothing more than chilling on the couch and enjoying a movie or a tv show.

while i don't have the time and energy for it like i used to, i love [playing computer games](../gameshelf.html).

i'm a big fan of beer and have tried thousands during my time but have settled on a few styles that i enjoy. as well as drinking beer, i enjoy brewing it.

my family is my biggest interest, among all the things listed above, my wife and my son are my number one priority.
