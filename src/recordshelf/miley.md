## fun facts

i got to see miley perform live at glastonbury 2019 on the pyramid stage. what can i say, miley can put on a show, miley can sing damnit. i'd listened to her albums, watched her music videos and checked out her backyard sessions, but seeing her live put a whole new persepective on her. 

i really want to see her perform plastic hearts, can't wait for touring to kick off again.
