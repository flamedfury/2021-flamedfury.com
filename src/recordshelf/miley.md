i got to see miley perform live at glastonbury 2019 on the pyramid stage. what can i say, miley can put on a show, miley can sing damnit. i'd listened to her albums, watched her music videos and checked out her backyard sessions, but seeing her live put a whole new persepective on her. 

i can't wait until the world opens up again and i may have the opportunity to see her live again.
