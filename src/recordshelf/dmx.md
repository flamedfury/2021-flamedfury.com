welcome to it's dark and hell is hot, my tribute to the late american rapper, DMX.

rest in peace DMX, 1970 - 2021

earl simmons, darkman x, better known as DMX was one of the greatest rappers to ever pick up a microphone, a legend from yonkers, ny. i first started getting into DMX around 99 and a lot of his music was present during many of the amazing times during my formative years. you would often hear dmx blasting out the windows of my car as me and my friends cruised through town. today (09/04/2021) will be a day of nothing but dmx for me. peace.
