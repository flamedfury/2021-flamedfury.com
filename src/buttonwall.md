the 88x31 button was first established and used by netscape to advertise their netscape navigator web broswer with the "netscape now!" button. from there, other people started making their own 88x31 buttons and thousands exist across the web and are still in use today. check out [eighty eight by thirty one](https://geocities.restorativland.org/NapaValley/2022/88x31.html) [(!*a)](https://web.archive.org/web/19990129040545/http://www.geocities.com/NapaValley/2022/88x31.html) for more info and some of the original buttons.
