## why i have a homepage

i believe in taking back control, reclaiming my digital future and contribute to rebuilding a web for everybody.

i don't have a website for popularity or making money. i want to develop interesting things to write and share. i don't care if anyone reads it or not. i don't want to share on social media.

i miss the personal, do it yourself aspect of everyone having their own homepage rather than a page within a closed social media platform. the rise of these social media platforms have lead to an [increasingly user-hostile web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/), and i don't like it.

websites and blogs these days are not organically passionate. they're just looking at ways to capitalise on any given subject, and an seo mess dilluting the usefulness of the web!

## the personal web
when i think of the web my first thoughts are of the personal web, and i smile.

the personal web is where everybody owns their own corner of cyber space where they can share what ever they want, and it is displayed how ever they want.

the personal web is not dictated by an algorithm. nor is it designed to sell you something.

however it may be designed to influence you in enjoying reading about something that brings joy to another netizen.

the medium of choice on the personal web is the personal homepage. with our own homepages we are free to choose the layout, design, graphics, fonts and colours of our homepages. it allows us to show off our personal style to the rest of the internet.

we can decide what goes where and don't care if it's beautiful or a beautiful mess.
