the internet used to be a huge place. netizens filled their time writing email, visiting forums, making websites, chatting on irc. they filled their bookmarks folder in their browsers with hundreds of places they enjoyed to visit across the web.

these days, the internet is smaller, reduced to a smaller number of places that people may visit every day. boring.

it's time to take it back.

## why i have a homepage

i believe in taking back control, reclaiming my digital future and contribute to rebuilding a web for everybody.

i don't have a website for popularity or making money. i want to develop interesting things to write and share. i don't care if anyone reads it or not. i don't want to share on social media.

i miss the personal, do it yourself aspect of everyone having their own homepage rather than a page within a closed social media platform. the rise of these social media platforms have lead to an [increasingly user-hostile web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/), and i don't like it.

websites and blogs these days are not organically passionate. they're just looking at ways to capitalise on any given subject, and an seo mess dilluting the usefulness of the web!

## the old web

it's hard for me to pin point when or where the old web finished for me. i want to say sometime around 2010...

to me the old web was not an aesthetic, but a community, not just one community but hundreds of little communities.

sure there were websites that we lovingly slapped together html with textured backgrounds and hard to read text and enough animated gifs to bring your internet connection to your knees, but there were also a lot of really nice looking websites, remember this was a time where we were starting to figure out what we could really do on this web thing.

to me, the old web was all about having your own place on the web, lovingly crafting your homepage and tending to it over time, filling it with whatever we felt was interesting.
we linked far and wide, to our favourite sites or new sites we came across that we thought were cool or interesting. we linked to each other. we didn't need a search engine to tell us where we might need to visit.

we posted useful information, information that got straight to the point. we didn't post recipes or guides with a 1000 word story on how a loaf of freshly baked bread straight out of the oven reminded us of spending summers at our grandparents farm. fuck that haha.

we were not confined to the walls of giant tech companies hostile silos of the internet.

## the personal web
when i think of the web my first thoughts are of the personal web, and i smile.

the personal web is where everybody owns their own corner of cyber space where they can share what ever they want, and it is displayed how ever they want.

the personal web is not dictated by an algorithm. nor is it designed to sell you something.

however it may be designed to influence you in enjoying reading about something that brings joy to another netizen.

the medium of choice on the personal web is the personal homepage. with our own homepages we are free to choose the layout, design, graphics, fonts and colours of our homepages. it allows us to show off our personal style to the rest of the internet.

we can decide what goes where and don't care if it's beautiful or a beautiful mess.

## the commercial web
the web today, social media is easy and people are lazy, or they don't know what more the web can offer them.

for the most part, facebook, twitter, instagram all make it very easy to share what's on peoples minds quickly with no setup.

which is fine. however, i don't see a too big of a difference between that and sharing the same stuff on your own personal home page, where you get to **own your own content**, except that the setup experience requires a few more steps than mindlessly entering every single piece of personal information.

## final thought
having a personal homepage is awesome, if you don't have one already, get one!
